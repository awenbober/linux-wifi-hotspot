### Notes

Sometimes there are troubles with **5Ghz bands** due to some vendor restrictions. If you cannot start hotspot while you are connected to 5Ghz band, Unselect **Auto** and select **2.4Ghz** in frequency selection.

If any problems with **RealTeK Wifi Adapters** see [this](docs/howto/realtek.md)
